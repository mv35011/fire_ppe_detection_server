    A target function for a process that continuously reads frames from a video source.

    This function is designed to run in its own process for each camera feed. It reads
    frames, resizes them for consistency, and puts them into a shared queue for the
    inference engine to process.

        source_path (str): The path to the video file or the camera stream URL.
        frame_queue (Queue): The shared multiprocessing queue to send frames to.
        target_fps (int): The desired frames per second to process from the video.
